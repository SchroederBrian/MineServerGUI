# Potential Feturs

## 🔌 Plugin Management UI

- This is a game-changer. Instead of manually downloading and uploading JAR files, users could search, install, update, and enable/disable plugins directly from the UI.

- This is a bigger feature. It would involve adding a "Plugins" tab. The backend would need to talk to an API like Modrinth or scrape SpigotMC. It would list installed plugins from the /plugins folder and allow searching for new ones, handling the download and installation automatically.

## Import/Export Server Setup

- A massive time-saver for power users. It allows them to perfectly replicate a server's configuration (scripts, software, etc.) or share their setup with others.

- We could add "Export" and "Import" buttons in the server settings. "Export" would tell the backend to bundle the start script, install script, and maybe even a list of plugins into a single JSON file for download. "Import" would allow uploading that file to apply the settings instantly.

## 🏷️ Server Grouping & Tagging

- For users running a network (e.g., Survival, Creative, Minigames), a flat list is inefficient. Grouping allows for better organization and management.

- A new "Group" text field could be added to the server settings. The main dashboard could then be updated to display servers under collapsible group headings (e.g., an accordion UI). This makes managing a dozen servers as easy as managing three.

## ⚡ Event-Based Triggers

- This is the ultimate power-user feature, creating a self-managing server. It allows the admin to define "if-this-then-that" rules to handle any situation automatically.

- We could add an "Automations" tab. The UI would allow creating rules. For example: IF Player Count > 15, THEN run console command "say The server is getting busy!". IF CPU Usage > 90% for 5 minutes, THEN send a Discord notification and run command "lagclear".
